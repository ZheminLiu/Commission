# Commission
Software Testing and Assurance Project

#Program Specification:
1. A rifle salesperson in the former Arizona Territory sold rifle locks, stocks, and barrels made by a gunsmith in Missouri. 
2. Locks cost $45, stocks cost $30, and barrels cost $25. 
3. The salesperson had to sell at least one complete rifle per month, and production limits were such that the most the salesperson could sell in a month was 70 locks, 80 stocks, and 90 barrels. 
4. After each town visit, the salesperson sent a telegram to the Missouri gunsmith with the number of locks, stocks, and barrels sold in that town. 
5. At the end of a month, the salesperson sent a very short telegram showing -1 locks sold. 
6. The gunsmith then knew the sales for the month were complete and computed the salesperson’s commission as follows: 10% on sales up to (and including) $1000, 15% on the next $800, and 20% on any sales in excess of $1800. 
7. The commission program produced a monthly sales report that gave the total number of locks, stocks, and barrels sold, the salesperson’s total dollar sales, and, finally, the commission.
